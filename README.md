# PHYS402Lab1D7
The code, data, and report for Lab 1 (D7-Diffraction Grating Monochromator/Raman Spectroscopy) in PHYS 402, Light, at the University of Illinois.
The lab handout, which contains the instructions for the project, is under D7.pdf. The report is under PHYS_402_Lab1_D7_.pdf and the code is under graph.pynb.
The rest of this repository is data obtained from the project or pictures used for the report. The exception to this is monochromator_files folder, which I believe contains files created by the monochromator during the experiment.
The code and report were written by me, Andrew Kim, with minor help from my lab partner Kendell Graff.
